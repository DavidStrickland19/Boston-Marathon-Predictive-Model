This project looks to import 2015, Boston Marathon Results, clean the data, and make predictions. I took the first 20 male finishers from the race, and looked to use their half marathon splits and see if this split, was an accurate indicator of their final overall race time. To make these predictions I used the Linear Regression Machine Learning predictor from the Scikit-learn package. I look to make more insightful observations about the race and how certain aspects can affect the race splits, final time, etc.
